- aio API - works on asyncio and trio:
  - gbulb.GLibEventLoop = perfect
  - others require GLib in the worker thread (without gbulb)
- sync API (implemented on top of AioGLib/asyncio/gbulb):
  - blocking internally runs gbulb.GLibEventLoop
  - others require AioGLib/asyncio/gbulb in the worker thread
